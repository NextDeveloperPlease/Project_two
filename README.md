#### Description
This repository contains three files. 
bert_install.bat: Creates a conda environment with all the prerequisite packages. It also activates the environment.
Analysis_v2.ipynb: Notebook containing the code to train a bert model and classifier.
llm-finetune-new.ipynb: Notebook to finetune the bert model (doesn't work yet)
#### Execution
Verify the integrity of the bert_install.bat file (open using notepad - don't double click, yet). It should create a conda environment, activate the environment, and install four packages to that environment. If it looks good, double click it and it should do its thing. Afterwards, open the notebook and click run.
