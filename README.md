#### Description
This repository contains three files. A .bat file to create a conda environment for a bert model with all the prerequisite libraries installed. A notebook that trains the bert model and runs a bert classification algorithm as the ml algorithm. Lastly, it contains another notebook that finetunes bert (don't use as it needs to be updated)
#### Execution
Verify the integrity of the bert_install.bat file (open using notepad - don't double click, yet). It should create a conda environment, activate the environment, and install four packages to that environment. If it looks good, double click it and it should do its thing. Afterwards, open the notebook and click run.
